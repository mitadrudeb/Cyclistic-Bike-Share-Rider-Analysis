    "\n",
    "### Recommendation 1: Weekend-to-Weekday Campaign\n",
    "- **Target:** Casual riders who ride on weekends\n",
    "- **Strategy:** \"Commute Challenge\" - encourage casual riders to try biking to work\n",
    "- **Offer:** Free first month membership trial\n",
    "- **Why:** 34.9% of casual rides are on weekends, showing regular engagement\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommendation 2: Seasonal Membership Tier\n",
    "- **Target:** Casual riders who only ride in summer\n",
    "- **Strategy:** Create a reduced-price \"Summer Membership\" (May-September)\n",
    "- **Offer:** Special perks like priority bike access and no unlock fees\n",
    "- **Why:** 68.8% of casual rides happen May-September\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommendation 3: In-App Targeted Notifications\n",
    "- **Target:** Casual riders during peak hours (4-6 PM)\n",
    "- **Strategy:** Send notifications showing potential membership savings\n",
    "- **Offer:** Real-time cost comparison: pay-per-ride vs membership\n",
    "- **Why:** Casual riders already peak at 4-6 PM, just need the value proposition\n",

    "1. **Data Cleaning matters** - Found and fixed a critical ride_length calculation error\n",
    "   that would have skewed the entire analysis\n",
    "2. **Stratified sampling** - Learned to maintain data proportions when reducing dataset\n",
    "   size for visualization tools\n",
    "3. **Business context** - Kept the analysis focused on a clear business question\n",
    "   throughout the entire process\n",
    "4. **Storytelling with data** - Created visualizations that tell a clear narrative\n",
    "   about user behavior differences\n",
    "5. **SQL for validation** - Used MySQL queries to cross-validate findings from\n",
    "   Python analysis, ensuring accuracy\n",
    "6. **Modern workflow** - Leveraged AI assistants (like Anthropic's Claude) as a\n",
    "   learning and problem-solving tool during the analysis process, similar to how\n",
    "   professionals use these tools to accelerate data workflows while maintaining\n",
    "   critical thinking and validation of all outputs\n",
